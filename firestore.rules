/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Prayer App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that data is isolated by user.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/prayer_records/{prayerRecordId}: Stores prayer records for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/dhikr_records/{dhikrRecordId}: Stores dhikr records for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/dhikrs/{dhikrId}: Stores Dhikrs for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/day_streaks/{dayStreakId}: Stores day streak data for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, or delete their own data.
 * - Data for users is isolated using subcollections under their respective user IDs.
 * - `list` operations are restricted to the owner of the subcollection.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` is denormalized into the prayer_records, dhikr_records, dhikrs, and day_streaks documents to avoid costly `get()` calls when checking authorization.
